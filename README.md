###The Famous WFH Generator
===

Just a little meme generator for coming up with those pesky excuses for why it's critical you work from home today. 


#### TODO

- [ ] Make the meme an actual image using ImageMagik or some shit
- [ ] Add social sharing ability
- [ ] Build setup page with a form to accept inputs & script that dynamically generates the necessary DB & tables so that we can quickly generate specific use-case generators (ex: the Ric generator)
- [ ] Password protect manage page
- [ ] Build ability to scrape a Facebook profile for images
- [ ] Test and update mobile views
- [ ] Refactor my god-awful procedural PHP
- [ ] Make it look perrrty



#### Installation


1. Clone the repository somewhere running an -AMP stack
2. Edit config.php with your database creds
3. Run the wfh_original.sql file (note, the db and table name must match values entered in config.php's 'text-values' variable)
4. Load manage.php and start adding inputs
5. Profit
